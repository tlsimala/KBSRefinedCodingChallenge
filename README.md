# KBSRefinedCodingChallenge
Hi this is my resubmission for the Kaleido Coding Challenge! 

It felt really good to cut down code and simplify my solution!

Instructions:
   To get the code up and running, it is as simple as saving the repository onto your desktop and utilizing your commandline. Of course, depending on where it is saved this step will be different, but just make sure that if you utilize the ls command you can see the "KaleidoClientCode.java" "Compound.java" "Plate.java" and "Well.java" classes! 
    
    1. Download the repository 
    2. Use the commandline to access it
    3. Type "javac KaliedoClientCode.java Compound.java Plate.java Well.java" or "javac *.java"    into the commandline or terminal 
    4. Type java KaliedoClientCode 
    5. It should be running now and instead of creating a test suite, I wanted you to be able to interact with the program as if you were a scientist trying to enter information!
    
 I hope that you enjoy my new solution! (:
